Question:

The "file" table contains details of films we rent, including their name, rental cost and replacement cost. Take a look at the table and generate a query that tells me high value films, meaning those that:
a: have rental rate more than 2.99 OR
b: replacement cost more than 19.99


Ans:
SELECT title, rental_rate, replacement_cost FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 2.99 OR replacement_cost > 19.99;

Field -> title, rental_rate, replacement_cost
Criteria -> rental_rate > 2.99 OR replacement_cost > 19.99
