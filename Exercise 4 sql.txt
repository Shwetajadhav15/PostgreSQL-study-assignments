Question:

The "film" table has the replacement cost and rental duration (assume, in weeks) for each movie.

Can you tell me the movies(just the title and relevant details) sorted by highest to lowest 
replacement cost and rented out for 4-6 weeks.

Also I dont want all the data, just give me 100 records.

Ans:

SELECT title, replacement_cost, rental_duration FROM film 
where rental_duration between 4 and 6 
order by replacement_cost desc limit 100;

Fields -> title, replacement_cost, rental_duration
Criteria -> replacement_cost desc, rental_duration between 4 and 6, limit 100
