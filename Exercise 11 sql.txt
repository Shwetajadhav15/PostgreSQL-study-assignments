Question:
The "payment" table contains purchases done by each customer. This table has the column "customer_id" which
contains unique id of each customer and can be used to join on the the "customer" table to get each customers
first/last name and email address. I want to create a report that shows following columns:
• Customer name - combination of first and last name
• Email - email address of customer
• Total rental - total purchase done by the customer
• Customer Category based on following rules (HINT : USE "CASE")
  • 'Elite' - Total rentals more than $200
  • 'Platinum' - Total rentals more than $150
  • 'Gold' - Total rentals more than $100
  • 'Silver' - Total rentals more than $0

Ans:

SELECT Concat(customer.first_name,' ',customer.last_name) As "Customer Name", email As "Email", Sum(amount) As "Total Rentals", 
CASE
    WHEN sum(amount) >= 200 THEN 'Elite'
	WHEN sum(amount) >= 150 AND sum(amount) < 200 THEN 'Platinum'
	WHEN sum(amount) >= 100 AND sum(amount) < 150 THEN 'Gold'
	WHEN sum(amount) >= 0 AND sum(amount) <100 THEN 'Silver'
END
FROM payment
inner join customer
on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
group by "Customer Name", "Email";

Fields -> payment.customer_id, payment.amount, customer.customer_id, customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email
Tables -> payment, customer
Join -> inner join
Common Fields in both the tables -> payment.customer_id, customer.customer_id

Criteria:
CASE
    WHEN sum(amount) >= 200 THEN 'Elite'
	WHEN sum(amount) >= 150 AND sum(amount) < 200 THEN 'Platinum'
	WHEN sum(amount) >= 100 AND sum(amount) < 150 THEN 'Gold'
	WHEN sum(amount) >= 0 AND sum(amount) <100 THEN 'Silver'
END
