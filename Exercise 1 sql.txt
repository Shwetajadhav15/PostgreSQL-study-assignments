Question:

The "payment" table stores customer ids and amount they have paid. I want to get the list of customer ids that have rented out movies that cost 7.99 or more so I can put them in a "platinum" category and send them coupons later.

Can you give me a report containing that ?

Ans:
Select distinct customer_id from payment where amount>=7.99;

Field -> customer_id
Criteria -> amount >=7.99
