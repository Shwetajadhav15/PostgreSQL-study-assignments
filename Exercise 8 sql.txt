Question:

I want to create a report that shows the different ratings of all movies and count of movies that have
been rented for each rating.

The film_id and ratings are available under "film" table. The "rental" table shows each film that is 
rented,but it does not have film_id as a column, so you would have to find a 3rd table that can get 
you that info.

Ans:

SELECT film.rating, count(film.rental_rate) FROM film
inner join inventory
on film.film_id = inventory.film_id
inner join rental
on rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
group by film.rating
order by count(film.rental_rate) desc;


Checklist:
Step 1: What is the information you want ?
Fields -> film.rating, number of time they were rented 

Step 2: Which tables to join ?
Tables join -> film, rental, inventory

Step 3: Which common field to use to join?
Commom columns/fields -> film.film_id = inventory.film_id
                         rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
