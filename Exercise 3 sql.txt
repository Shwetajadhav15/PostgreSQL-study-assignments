Question:

I want a list of all movies that either have the rating 'G' OR 'PG'.

The movies must be longer than 120 minutes in length, and they should have the word 'Action'
anywhere in the description.


Ans:

SELECT title, description, length, rating FROM film 
where rating in('G','PG') and length>120 and description like '%Action%';

Fields -> title, rating, description, length
Criteria -> rating in('G','PG') , length >120 , description like '%Action%'
