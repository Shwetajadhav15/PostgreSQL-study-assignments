Question:

Which are my top 5 highest renting customers? How much they have spent?

Hints:
- Use the "payment" table
- How much they have spent? => this is the aggregation (SUM) of amount

Ans:
SELECT customer_id, sum(amount) FROM payment 
group by customer_id 
order by sum(amount) desc 
limit 5;

Fileds -> customer_id, amount
