Question:

The "rental" table has fields for rental_date( when the movie was rented), and return_date (when it was returned).
We want to reach out to customers whose rental duration was 7 or more days, and send them an email. 
Can you create a report for me that lists down following columns:
• Rental date
• Return date
• Rent duration - that is difference between two dates (HINT: Use AGE function)
• Customer first name
• Customer last name
• Customer email

You can find the last 3 fields in the "customer" table.

Keep the date sorted by rent duration (high to low) so we can see the longest renters first.

Ans:
select rental.rental_date, rental.return_date, age(return_date, rental_date) as "Rent duration", 
customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email from rental
inner join customer
on rental.rental_id = customer.customer_id
where age(return_date, rental_date) >= interval '7 days'
order by "Rent duration" desc ;

Fields -> rental.rental_date, rental.return_date, customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email

Tables -> rental , customer
